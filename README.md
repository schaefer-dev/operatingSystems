# Grading
## Important Style notes:
- C source files to be at most 79 characters long
- If you remove existing Pintos code, please delete it from your source file entirely (not out-commenting)

## General Notes
- We're only going to do a compile in the directory for the project being submitted. You don't need to make sure that the previous projects also compile.
- Double check with [sample Project Documentation](http://courses.mpi-sws.org/os-ws17/assignments/pintos/pintos_9.html)
