In sup_page.h:

#define STACK_SIZE (8 * 1048576)

STACK_SIZE determines the maximum of a stack in our case 8 MB.


/* Different statuses the page can have */
enum page_status
  {
    PAGE_STATUS_NOT_LOADED = 1,          /* page not loaded */
    PAGE_STATUS_LOADED = 2,              /* Page Loaded */
    PAGE_STATUS_SWAPPED = 4,             /* Page Eviced and writen to SWAP */
  };

Page status determines the current state of a page to check whether it loaded
or the location from where it has to be loaded.

enum page_type
  {
    PAGE_TYPE_FILE = 1,
    PAGE_TYPE_STACK = 2,

Page type is used to distinguish the possible types of a type to choose the
correct function to load/delete a page.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

If the page is already loaded the frame exists and the access to the frame
succeed.
If a page fault occurs:
1.) We search for a sup_page_entry in exception.c using vm_sup_page_lookup
with the current thread and the virtual address which casued the page fault,
however this address is rounded down using pg_round_down.

case 1: the frame was not found
2.1.) We check if the condition for stack_growth is fulfilled and calls 
vm_grow_stack if the condition holds. This function acquires the 
grow_stack_lock and creates a new sup_page_entry using vm_sup_page_allocate.
In the next step we acquire the lock of the newly generated sup_page_entry
and call vm_frame_allocate to get a physical page. Afterwards the held locks
are released.

case 2: the frame was found
2.2.) We call vm_sup_page_load on the found sup_page_entry. This function first
acquires the page_lock of this sup_page_entry and pins the page. In the next
step we switch over the status of the page. If the page is already laoded we 
simply release the lock and return b.c. the page is already loaded. 
If the status indicates the page is swapped we call vm_load_swap on this
sup_page_entry to load the page. (This will be explained in more detail later
on).
If the page is not loaded we call vm_load_file on this sup_page_entry
(b.c. a stack is either loaded or swapped). 

3.2.)
A page/frame to write the data in will be allocated using vm_frame_allocate.
This function tries to allocate a using palloc_get_page. If this physical 
address is NULL we need to evict a page by calling vm_evict_page (explained 
in more detail later on) which returns a physical address.
After receiving a physical address we set it in the sup_page_entry and create
a new struct frame and insert it into the frame list.
After receiving a frame we read the data from our file to the frame/physical
address and release the lock.

3.3.) 
The instruction which caused the page fault will be executed again.

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

//TODO rework

In page fault the kernel virtual addresses can only only be accessed 
in case of a stack growth is needed. To handle this case we save the
current stack pointer in the current thread every times syscall is done.
With this approach we can get the current stack pointer from the thread
and call stack growth if it is needed.
In all other cases we avoid kernel addresses in all cases by checking
if the all accesses are legal user acccesses in every single syscall.
To do so we check the esp, and validate the complete buffer and strings.
In order to do so we check if the address is in user virtual memory and
if there already exists a sup_page_entry. Furthermore, we load and pin 
the pages in the start of each syscall and unpin the pages when the
syscall ends.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

We got a global frame_lock avoids races. In more detail, there is only
one possibility to get a frame by calling vm_frame_allocate. This function
directly acquires the frame_lock and holds it until it returns. 
Within this function vm_evict_page could be called but this function can
only be called if the frame_lock is held by the current thread.
This ensures that only one user can get a new frame at the same time.
Furthermore, there is only one function which deletes frames, called
vm_frame_free which also acquires the lock at the very beginning.
Furthermore frames are manually freed and removed from the frame list
in vm_evict_page but this is okay because the lock is held in this case.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

We decided to take a hashmap to store sup_page_entry's because we will
often perform a lookup on supplemental pages and this is very efficient
using a hashmap. Furthermore, we only have to iterate over all pages in the
case of a process exit, however this function is also efficiently supported
if the hashmap will be deleted.
Furthermore we need the page_lock in each sup_page because the status of a 
page could change during a page eviction which is done by a different thread.
To ensure that all writes and reads of fields in the sup_page_entry this lock
is needed.
Furthermore, a supplemental page needs to store the current state and the type
to handle the page correctly. Since 3 possibile states and 3 types are possible
we decided to create enums to avoid using different structs or many booleans.
The virtual address and file information have to be stored to load the page 
and identify the pages. The mmap_id is also needed to handle munmap.
Pinned is used to prevent eviction of this page. This is done to avoid 
page faults in kernel while accessing user memory (e.g. buffer). Because
these kind of page faults cannot be resolved (e.g. because of held locks).

Frames are stored in a list because we often need to iterate over all used
frames (see page eviction). Furthermore, we often add and delete frames,
this is also efficient using lists and we don't need efficient lookups
on frames.
Frames of course have to store their location (physical address) and the
corresponding page (sup_page_entry). The frame_lock is needed to avoid
that races occur in case of 2 user processes need a new frame at the same
time (see above).

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In swap:
- static struct block *swap: block which is used as swap partition

- static unsigned swap_size: stores how many pages can be contained
in the swap-block

- static uint32_t SECTORS_FOR_PAGE = PGSIZE / BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE:
 Number of sectors necessary to store an entire page

/* value true -> free swap */
- static struct bitmap *swap_free_bitmap: bitmap used to indicate
which swap slots are in use and which are free

- static struct lock swap_lock: lock to ensure safe swap in and out

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

We use the clock algorithm to evict frames. In more detail:
We got a static iterator which points to the next element in the frame
list which will be considered to check for page eviction. This is 
necessary to ensure that the algorithm starts at the point it stopped
in the last iteration.
In the eviction step we start at the mentioned iterator position and
iterate until we find a page which access bit is not set.
In order to do so we first check if the page is pinned. In the case
that the page is pinned we move the iterator to the next element in 
the list using vm_evict_page_next_iterator.(If we reach the end of the
frame list the iterator is set to the begin of the list).
In case of an unpinned page we take the page_lock of this page and
check if the access bit is set. If it is set we set it to false and
move to the next element and release the lock.
Otherwise, the page can be evicted. This is done by checking the page
type and calling the correct eviction function. A stack is evicted by
vm_evict_stack which writes the page content to the swap partition and
sets the status of the sup_page_entry to PAGE_STATUS_SWAPPED.
A file is evicted using vm_evict_file. This function checks if the page
is dirty and writes it to swap if necessary and sets the page status
either to swapped or not loaded.
A memory mapped file page is written back to the file if the page is dirty
and the page status is set to not_loaded independent of the dirty bit.
Independent of the page type the following happens:
1.) The physical address of the page is set to NULL and the lock is released
2.) We move the iterator to the next element in the list.
3.) The frame is removed from the frame list.
4.) The page is removed from the process pagedir using pagedir_clear_page
5.) The physical page is freed using palloc_free_page
6.) The struct frame is freed
7.) A new physical page is allocated and its physical address is returned
to vm_frame_allocate (vm_evict_page was called by vm_frame_allocate)

The gloabal iterator is also moved if the frame it currently points to
will be deleted (only possible using vm_frame_free) because in this case
we check if the deleted frame is the current iterator frame and the move
the iterator accordingly.

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

As already mentioned in this case we set the page status of the sup_page_entry
of process Q to either swapped or not_loaded (depends on the dirty bit and the
page type) and the phys_addr to NULL. Furthermore, the entry in the page
directory of the corresponding thread is cleared.
The frame itself is removed from the frame_list and the physical page is
freed by using palloc_free_page and the struct frame is freed.
Process P gets a new physical page which is allocated using palloc_get_page.

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an

// TODO remember to set stack_size in file to nicer formated number (hex)

If a page fault occurs and there is no supplemental page table which
contains the requested virtual adress we have to check if a stack_growth
is valid. This is done by checking if the fault adress is between PHYS_BASE
and esp-32. Additionally we have to verify that the stack does not grow
further than its maximum size, which is set to 8 Megabytes in our case
as suggested in the Project description.



---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

1) We allow for shared access of ressources (for example frame list
is shared for all threads/sup_pages).
2) No preemption is obviously fullfilled with the lock implementation
3) The eviction holds the Frame lock, and can possibly wait for the
lock of one sup_page because the thread to which this sup_page belongs
currently changes fields of the sup_page. Evict will continue as soon as
all changes to the sup_page struct have been performed (and the lock will
be acquired)
4) Circularities: (dynamic condition)
It is impossible for circularities to occur because the frame lock
is always acquired before any of the sup_page locks except for 1 special case:
During the eviction we already hold the lock for the sup page for which
we are trying to get a physical page. Because each frame only corresponds
one page and one page corresponds to at most one frame, there cannot be
a frame contained in the frame list which corresponds to the sup_page of
which we already hold the lock when the eviction starts. Because we can 
only acquire the locks of sup pages which have currently loaded frames 
during an eviction process. This means that it is impossible to achieve
a circularity during the eviction.

The eviction process will always hold the frame_lock. As soon as the Q's
Page will be uninstalled a page fault in Q will occur and Q will try to
load the evicted page again. This loading also has to acquire the frame_lock.
This means that it can only start after the eviction process is 
completed entirely. The reading and changing of values (e.g. status of the 
page changes from PAGE_STATUS_LOADED to PAGE_STATUS_SWAPPED/NOT_LOADED) is 
additionally synchronized to avoid data races (explained in more detail
in other answers).

Frames which are currently being read in are not contained in the 
frame_list because they are only inserted after the read is completely
finished. This insertion is protected using the Frame_lock, which has
to be held during the entire eviciton process. This means a currently
loading page can never be evicted!

In syscall we make sure to load AND pin all neccessary data (strings/
buffers) during the verification of these structures. This assures
that these strings/buffers can not be evicted during the syscall because
evict will not consider any pinned pages (important: setting pinned
to true/false is synchronized using the pages page_lock).
As soon as the syscall is finished we set the pinned value for all
previously pinned pages of this syscall to false, which means they 
could possibly be evicted again.
Additially we make sure to store the ESP at the beginning of each
syscall to be able to access it during a page fault in this syscall,
so we can check the conditions to perform a stack_growth.

// TODO maybe move frame locking to be only around inserting into frame list and around free/evict
// TODO warnings
We offer very efficient locking. It is quite clear that we have to acquire
and hold the frame_lock during the entire frame allocation process (which
might contain an evict process) and also during the frame free process.
This is essential, because all threads work on the same list of Frames, and
e.g. Frames which are not yet completely loaded are not allowed to be evicted
etc.
The other lock which is absolutely neccessary is a lock which protects
all the fields of a sup_page. This might not seem neccessary at first
glance but not only the thread to which the sup_page belongs writes
into its fields but also other threads which might access this sup_page
during an eviction process will read (and potentially change) values of 
its fields. Its clear that the struct has to be protected against these 
data races and therefore both read and write accesses on a sup_page 
have to be protected using a lock. 
The list of sup_pages in each thread doesnt have to be protected using 
a lock beacuse only the thread to which this sup_page list belongs will
work on/modify this list using the sup_page allocation and the removal
of sup_pages (e.g. during termination of said thread).
All this could be done only using the Frame_lock but this would severely
