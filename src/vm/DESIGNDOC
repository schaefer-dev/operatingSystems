In sup_page.h:

#define STACK_SIZE (8 * 1048576)

STACK_SIZE determines the maximum of a stack in our case 8 MB.


/* Different statuses the page can have */
enum page_status
  {
    PAGE_STATUS_NOT_LOADED = 1,          /* page not loaded */
    PAGE_STATUS_LOADED = 2,              /* Page Loaded */
    PAGE_STATUS_SWAPPED = 4,             /* Page Eviced and writen to SWAP */
  };

Page status determines the current state of a page to check whether it loaded
or the location from where it has to be loaded. 

/* Different types the page can have */
enum page_type
  {
    PAGE_TYPE_FILE = 1,
    PAGE_TYPE_STACK = 2,
    PAGE_TYPE_MMAP = 4,
  };

Page type is used to distinguish the possible types of a type to choose the
correct function to load/delete a page.


struct sup_page_entry
  {
    enum page_status status;
    enum page_type type;

    /* physical address of supplemental page */

    /* thread this frame belongs to */
    struct thread *thread;

    /* offset at which this page starts reading the referenced file */

    struct file *file;

    /* id to identify mmap */
    int mmap_id;

    /* bool to indicate if file/page is writable */
    bool writable;

    /* bool to indicate if the page is pinned */
    bool pinned;

    /* palloc flags which are used when the frame is created */
    enum palloc_flags pflags;

    /* locks changes in struct sup_page_entry */
    struct lock page_lock;

    struct hash_elem h_elem;
  };

- sup_page_entry: data strcuture to store suppplemental pages

- page_lock: lock used such that field in sup_page_entry
(e.g. status) can be read and written safely

- h_elem: hash_elem to store sup_page_entry in hashmap

In frame.h:

struct lock frame_lock;

- frame_lock: global lock to ensure that frames are safely added/deleted

struct lock grow_stack_lock;

- grow_stack_lock: global lock to ensure that only one stack_growth at a
 time can happen


struct frame
  {
    /* physical address of frame */
    void *phys_addr;               

    /* supplemental Page Table Entry in which this frame is stored. */
    // for shared memory implementation, this will change into a list of sup_page_entries
    struct sup_page_entry *sup_page_entry;

    // thread which holds this frame to set the pagedir
    //struct thread *thread;

    struct list_elem l_elem;
  };

- struct frame: struct to store physical memory pages

Fields:
- pyhs_addr: physical address of this frame (received by palloc_get_page)

- sup_page_entry: page to which this frame belongs to

- thread: thread which owns this frame

- l_elem: list_elem to store frames in a list

In frame.c:

 which is check in case of page eviction (start of clock algorithm iteration)

In thread.h:

- struct hash sup_page_hashmap: hashmap to store all supplemental pages of
a process


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

If the page is already loaded the frame exists and the access to the frame
succeed.
If a page fault occurs:
1.) We search for a sup_page_entry in exception.c using vm_sup_page_lookup
with the current thread and the virtual address which casued the page fault,
however this address is rounded down using pg_round_down.

case 1: the frame was not found
2.1.) We check if the condition for stack_growth is fulfilled and calls 
vm_grow_stack if the condition holds. This function acquires the 
grow_stack_lock and creates a new sup_page_entry using vm_sup_page_allocate.
In the next step we acquire the lock of the newly generated sup_page_entry
and call vm_frame_allocate to get a physical page. Afterwards the held locks
are released.

case 2: the frame was found
2.2.) We call vm_sup_page_load on the found sup_page_entry. This function first
acquires the page_lock of this sup_page_entry and pins the page. In the next
step we switch over the status of the page. If the page is already laoded we 
simply release the lock and return b.c. the page is already loaded. 
If the status indicates the page is swapped we call vm_load_swap on this
sup_page_entry to load the page. (This will be explained in more detail later
on).
If the page is not loaded we call vm_load_file on this sup_page_entry
(b.c. a stack is either loaded or swapped). 

3.2.)
A page/frame to write the data in will be allocated using vm_frame_allocate.
This function tries to allocate a using palloc_get_page. If this physical 
address is NULL we need to evict a page by calling vm_evict_page (explained 
in more detail later on) which returns a physical address.
After receiving a physical address we set it in the sup_page_entry and create
a new struct frame and insert it into the frame list.
After receiving a frame we read the data from our file to the frame/physical
address and release the lock.

3.3.) 
The instruction which caused the page fault will be executed again.

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

In page fault the kernel virtual addresses can only only be accessed 
in case of a stack growth is needed. To handle this case we save the
current stack pointer in the current thread every times syscall is done.
With this approach we can get the current stack pointer from the thread
and call stack growth if it is needed.
In all other cases we avoid kernel addresses in all cases by checking
if the all accesses are legal user acccesses in every single syscall.
To do so we check the esp, and validate the complete buffer and strings.
In order to do so we check if the address is in user virtual memory and
if there already exists a sup_page_entry. Furthermore, we load and pin 
the pages in the start of each syscall and unpin the pages when the
syscall ends.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

We got a global frame_lock avoids races. In more detail, there is only
one possibility to get a frame by calling vm_frame_allocate. This function
directly acquires the frame_lock and holds it until it returns. 
Within this function vm_evict_page could be called but this function can
only be called if the frame_lock is held by the current thread.
This ensures that only one user can get a new frame at the same time.
Furthermore, there is only one function which deletes frames, called
vm_frame_free which also acquires the lock at the very beginning.
Furthermore frames are manually freed and removed from the frame list
in vm_evict_page but this is okay because the lock is held in this case.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

We decided to take a hashmap to store sup_page_entry's because we will
often perform a lookup on supplemental pages and this is very efficient
using a hashmap. Furthermore, we only have to iterate over all pages in the
case of a process exit, however this function is also efficiently supported
if the hashmap will be deleted.
Furthermore we need the page_lock in each sup_page because the status of a 
page could change during a page eviction which is done by a different thread.
To ensure that all writes and reads of fields in the sup_page_entry this lock
is needed.
Furthermore, a supplemental page needs to store the current state and the type
to handle the page correctly. Since 3 possibile states and 3 types are possible
we decided to create enums to avoid using different structs or many booleans.
The virtual address and file information have to be stored to load the page 
and identify the pages. The mmap_id is also needed to handle munmap.
Pinned is used to prevent eviction of this page. This is done to avoid 
page faults in kernel while accessing user memory (e.g. buffer). Because
these kind of page faults cannot be resolved (e.g. because of held locks).

Frames are stored in a list because we often need to iterate over all used
frames (see page eviction). Furthermore, we often add and delete frames,
this is also efficient using lists and we don't need efficient lookups
on frames.
Frames of course have to store their location (physical address) and the
corresponding page (sup_page_entry). The frame_lock is needed to avoid
that races occur in case of 2 user processes need a new frame at the same
time (see above).
